## landing page project.
I've make some modification in [HTML] and [CSS ]files,


[html]
First I added the <"app.jss"> to start working on it ,then I added new section called "section 4" ,because the least number of project is "4" .

[CSS file] 
 
 
I made some changes in **color** and **font size** , also changed the <hover color> and the <cursor shape>..,then I used [media query property] to make the [landing page project] suitable and responsive to all devices .




Finally I used [app.js] file to do some dynamic properties.
1)I have defined the [global variable] at the top of app.js.


2) I have created new elements in navigation bar  {#navbar__list}, by using [.createElement()] and [.appendChild] +property. to create list items in navigation bar.


2) I have made the Scrolling behavior is so[ smooth ] by using some techniques like 
[scrollIntoView] and [addEventListener] and make the default so smooth on scrolling and move to certain section.


3)I have added [active class] , using some properties like [addEventListener] and [conditions] to add {active-class} to navlink and sections and [.forEach] to looping to all anchors and sections.
